# TriSpell

TriSpell is a small and simple console application for basic spellchecking.

## Features

As a fun little side project of mine, TriSpell was intended to explore how basic spell checking
could be implemented using the so-called
[Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) metric. Named after the
Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who originally defined it in 1965, this metric computes
the similarity of two sequences of characters (or "strings" in most modern programming languages):

- A source string that can be thought of as a word which the user typed.
- A target string that represents a word the user may have intended to type (but misspelled).

The metric itself, sometimes simply called "edit distance", is defined as the minimum number of
single-character edits (i. e. insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform the
source string into the target string. It can be implemented using a variety of different algorithms,
and as such TriSpell offers three of the more common implementations for the user to choose from:

| Algorithm                  | Efficiency | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Recursive                  | --         | A naive, recursive implementation that more or less directly corresponds to the original mathematical definition by Vladimir Levenshtein. It shows a very poor efficiency (especially on larger inputs), since a lot of the prefixes of the source and target strings are unnecessarily compared more than once (unless memoization is used).|
| Iterative Full Matrix      | +          | This slightly more advanced implementation employs techniques of dynamic programming. It uses a two-dimensional matrix to cache the edit distances between all prefixes of the source and target strings, thus avoiding unnecessary calculations.                                                                                            |
| Iterative Optimized Matrix | ++         | Even more advanced implementation that makes use of an important optimization: For calculating the edit distance at a certain position, only the previous and current row of edit distances are ever needed. This usually reduces the memory footprint and runtime even further in comparison to the full matrix algorithm.                  |

For more details on the individual algorithms see
[this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) from Wikipedia, which also
contains useful pseudocode I used as reference for the implementation.

In addition to the algorithms, the user can choose from three different levels of accuracy.
While the specific implementation (i. e. the maximum edit distance per level) may change in the
future, it is currently defined as follows:

| Accuracy Level | Maximum Edit Distance |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Low            | 3                     |
| Medium         | 2                     |
| High           | 1                     |

Feel free to experiment with this and customize it to your liking. ðŸ˜‰

## Dependencies and usage

TriSpell was originally developed using `.NET 8` and `C# 12`. I recently upgraded it to `.NET 9` and
`C# 13` and plan to continue doing so in the future to take advantage of new language features and
performance improvements. For now, just follow these steps to try out TriSpell:

0. Make sure you have `.NET 9` or a later version installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository (or download the source code) to a directory of your choice.
   
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Piwimau/TriSpell.git ./TriSpell
   cd ./TriSpell
   ```

2. Run the application in release mode to achieve the best performance.
   
   ```shell
   dotnet run -c Release
   ```

Alternatively, if you have Visual Studio installed on your machine, simply open the provided
[solution file](TriSpell.sln) and proceed from there.

## Contributing

I don't really expect any contributions, as TriSpell is more or less just one of my little side
projects. However, if you find a bug or have a nice suggestion, feel free to open an issue and I'll
see what I can do.

I was originally inspired to create TriSpell after watching
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu7Tl7FGigQ)
by [Creel](https://www.youtube.com/@WhatsACreel), which features some nice animations and
explanations of the algorithms. I can highly recommend the video and the channel in general for
anyone interested in low-level programming concepts.
